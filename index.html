          I was looking for a programing language easy and useful for a Network Engineer. In this search I found different languages like:
          <ul>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>Python</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="middle">
          I find some aspects that to consider before to decide the rigth programming language:
          <ol>
            <li>Purpose</li>
            <li>Ease of Development and Maintenance</li>
            <li>Efficiency</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="bottom">
          After consider each aspect, the programing language that most interest me was python. I decide to take the class "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript" to learn some basics.
